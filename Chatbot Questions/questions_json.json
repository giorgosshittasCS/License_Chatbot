    "This asks if you're okay with others changing your code. Depending on your preference, you can allow full modifications, specific types of changes, or none at all.",
    "Here, you decide if others can use your software or modified versions (derivatives) to make money. Allowing this may require charging a fee or offering specific terms.",
    "This asks if programs combining your software can be kept closed-source (code hidden), or if the combined code must be shared openly. Consider how important open access is to you.",
    "This means others who get a license from you can grant licenses to others (sublicense). Decide if you want control over who uses your software or prefer others to manage it further.",
    "This affects how changes to your software are shared. You can require the same license (copyleft) or allow different licenses (permissive). Consider if you want consistent terms or flexibility.",
    "This asks if you want people to mention changes they made when sharing your software or derivatives. This helps track modifications and protect your original work.",
    "This applies to software accessed over a network (like websites). You can decide if users interacting with it (e.g., browsing a site) need access to the underlying code. Consider transparency and potential misuse.",
    "This asks if you want legal protection for your software's code, features, or name. Copyright covers the code, patents protect specific functionalities, and trademarks safeguard unique names/logos.",
    "Even if you share your software, you can typically retain copyright unless stated otherwise. This allows you to claim ownership and potentially seek legal action if your rights are violated.",
    "If others contribute code to your project, you can decide if they retain patent rights related to their additions. This affects who can use those specific functionalities.",
    "This asks if others can use your unique names or logos within their applications. Decide if you want to control how your brand identity is used."
